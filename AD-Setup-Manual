**Step 1: Define Lab Objectives**

- **Explanation:** Clearly define your objectives for the lab, such as learning Active Directory, testing specific configurations, or simulating real-world scenarios. Having a clear goal will guide your actions throughout the setup.

**Step 2: Select Virtualization Platform**

- **Instructions:**
    - Download and install Oracle VirtualBox on your host machine.
    - Open VirtualBox to start creating your virtual machines.

**Step 3: Prepare the Host Machine**

- **Instructions:** Ensure your host machine has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to run virtual machines efficiently. Check system requirements for VirtualBox and make sure your host machine meets them.

**Step 4: Create Virtual Machines (VMs)**

- **Instructions:**
    - In VirtualBox, click "New" to create a new virtual machine.
    - Name your VMs (e.g., "DC" for domain controller and "Client" for the client machine).
    - Choose the appropriate operating system (Windows Server 2019 for DC and Windows 10 for the client).
    - Allocate an appropriate amount of RAM (e.g., 2GB for the DC and 1GB for the client).
    - Create a virtual hard disk with sufficient storage (e.g., 40GB).
    - Review your settings and click "Create" to create the VMs.

**Step 5: Install Operating Systems**

- **Instructions:**
    - Select the VM in VirtualBox and click "Start" to boot from the Windows Server 2019 ISO file for the domain controller.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows Server 2019.
    - Repeat the same process for the client machine using the Windows 10 ISO.

**Step 6: Configure Network Settings**

- **Instructions:**
    - In VirtualBox, select each VM and click "Settings."
    - Under "Network," set up two network adapters for each VM. For the DC VM, choose "NAT" and "Internal Network." For the client VM, select "Internal Network."
    - Give each adapter a recognizable name, like "NAT" and "Internal."

**Step 7: Install Active Directory and Configure Domain**

- **Instructions:**
    - Start the DC VM and log in with the administrator password.
    - Open "Server Manager."
    - Click "Add roles and features" and follow the wizard.
    - Select the "Active Directory Domain Services" role and complete the installation.
    - After installation, click the flag in Server Manager and choose "Promote this server to a domain controller."
    - Follow the prompts to create a new forest with a specified domain name.

**Step 8: Create Administrator Accounts**

- **Instructions:**
    - In Server Manager, open "Active Directory Users and Computers."
    - Right-click the "Users" container and create a new organizational unit (OU) named "Admins."
    - Inside the "Admins" OU, create user accounts with admin privileges.
    - Add these accounts to the "Domain Admins" group.

**Step 9: Set Up Routing and Remote Access (RAS) and Network Address Translation (NAT)**

- **Instructions:**
    - In Server Manager, click "Add roles and features."
    - Select "Remote Access" and follow the wizard to install RAS.
    - Configure NAT for the internal network adapter to provide internet access.

**Step 10: Configure DHCP Server**

- **Instructions:**
    - In Server Manager, install the "DHCP Server" role.
    - Create a DHCP scope for IP address assignment within the internal network.
    - Set the lease duration and configure DHCP options for DNS and gateway.

**Step 11: Optimize Browser Security**

- **Instructions:**
    - Disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration from the "Local Server" settings in Server Manager.

**Step 12: Automate User Account Creation**

- **Instructions:**
    - Download the PowerShell script for creating user accounts.
    - Open PowerShell ISE and enable script execution with the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.
    - Run the script to create user accounts.

**Step 13: Create Windows 10 Client VM**

- **Instructions:**
    - In VirtualBox, create a new VM for the Windows 10 client.
    - Configure its network settings to use the same internal network adapter as the domain controller.

**Step 14: Test the Setup**

- **Instructions:**
    - Start the Windows 10 client VM and join it to the domain.
    - Test user authentication, network access, and internet access.

By following these detailed step-by-step instructions, you can set up a functional Active Directory lab environment for learning, testing, or simulating real-world corporate scenarios.
